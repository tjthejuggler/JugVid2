# Video Feed System Upgrade

**Date:** 2025-08-18  
**Author:** Roo  
**Version:** 2.0.0

## Overview

The juggling_tracker application has been upgraded with a new dynamic video feed system that supports multiple simultaneous video feeds with automatic layout management and real-time latency monitoring.

## Key Features

### 1. Dynamic Layout System
- **1-3 feeds**: Arranged in a single row
- **4-6 feeds**: Arranged in two rows (maximum 3 feeds per row)
- **Automatic resizing**: Window and layout adjust automatically based on feed count
- **Responsive design**: Other UI elements are pushed down dynamically

### 2. Latency Monitoring
- **Real-time latency tracking**: Each feed displays current latency in milliseconds
- **FPS monitoring**: Live FPS calculation for each feed
- **Performance metrics**: Accessible via API for system monitoring

### 3. Feed Management
- **Dynamic addition/removal**: Feeds can be added or removed at runtime
- **Named feeds**: Each feed has a customizable display name
- **Unique identification**: Each feed has a unique ID for programmatic access

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### VideoFeedWidget
- Individual feed display widget
- Handles latency calculation and FPS monitoring
- Displays feed name, FPS, and latency information
- Minimum size: 160x120 pixels for readability

#### VideoFeedManager
- Manages multiple VideoFeedWidget instances
- Handles dynamic grid layout (1-3 feeds = 1 row, 4-6 feeds = 2 rows)
- Emits signals when feed count changes
- Provides API for feed management

#### MainWindow Integration
- Replaced single `video_label` with `VideoFeedManager`
- Updated `update_frame()` method to support multiple feeds
- Added feed management methods
- Dynamic window resizing based on feed count

## API Reference

### MainWindow Methods

```python
# Feed Management
add_video_feed(feed_name, feed_id=None) -> str
remove_video_feed(feed_id) -> bool
clear_all_feeds() -> None
set_feed_name(feed_id, name) -> None

# Monitoring
get_feed_latencies() -> dict  # feed_id -> latency_ms
get_feed_fps() -> dict        # feed_id -> fps
get_latency_summary() -> str  # Formatted summary

# Testing
demo_feed_configurations() -> None  # Demo different layouts
```

### VideoFeedManager Methods

```python
# Core Management
add_feed(feed_name, feed_id=None) -> str
remove_feed(feed_id) -> bool
update_feed(feed_id, pixmap) -> None

# Information
get_feed_count() -> int
get_feed_ids() -> list
get_feed_latencies() -> dict
get_feed_fps() -> dict
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Feed Management

```python
# Add feeds
main_feed = window.add_video_feed("Main Camera")
depth_feed = window.add_video_feed("Depth View")

# Update feeds with new frames
window.video_feed_manager.update_feed(main_feed, color_pixmap)
window.video_feed_manager.update_feed(depth_feed, depth_pixmap)

# Monitor performance
latencies = window.get_feed_latencies()
print(f"Main camera latency: {latencies[main_feed]:.1f}ms")
```

### Dynamic Feed Types

The system now supports different feed types based on display settings:

1. **Main Composite Feed**: Always present, shows combined color/depth/masks
2. **Separate Depth Feed**: When depth is enabled but not in composite
3. **Mask Feeds**: Individual feeds for each mask type
4. **Simple Tracking Mask**: Dedicated feed for tracking visualization

## Layout Behavior

### Single Row (1-3 feeds)
```
[Feed 1] [Feed 2] [Feed 3]
```
- Minimum window width: max(1280, feed_count * 320)
- Minimum window height: 720

### Two Rows (4-6 feeds)
```
[Feed 1] [Feed 2] [Feed 3]
[Feed 4] [Feed 5] [Feed 6]
```
- Minimum window width: max(1280, 3 * 320)
- Minimum window height: 900

## Performance Considerations

### Latency Calculation
- Measured as time between frame updates
- Updated in real-time for each feed
- Displayed with 0.1ms precision

### FPS Calculation
- Rolling average over recent frames
- Reset periodically to maintain accuracy
- Updated every second via timer

### Memory Management
- Automatic cleanup of removed feeds
- Efficient pixmap handling
- Minimal memory overhead per feed

## Testing

### Test Script
A comprehensive test script is provided: `test_video_feed_system.py`

Features:
- Interactive feed addition/removal
- Automatic demo of different configurations
- Generated test content with animation
- Real-time performance monitoring

### Running Tests
```bash
cd /home/twain/Projects/JugVid2
python test_video_feed_system.py
```

### Manual Testing
Use the "Demo Feed Configurations" menu item (Ctrl+F) in the main application to test different layouts.

## Migration Notes

### Breaking Changes
- `video_label` is no longer directly accessible
- `update_frame()` method signature remains the same but behavior changed
- Mouse events for ball definition need to be reimplemented for individual feeds

### Compatibility
- Existing frame processing pipeline remains unchanged
- All display options (depth, masks, tracking) still work
- Extension system integration maintained

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Feed-specific controls**: Individual feed settings (brightness, contrast)
2. **Drag-and-drop reordering**: User-customizable feed arrangement
3. **Feed recording**: Individual feed recording capabilities
4. **Network feeds**: Support for remote video streams
5. **Feed synchronization**: Frame-accurate synchronization between feeds

### Performance Optimizations
1. **GPU acceleration**: Hardware-accelerated frame processing
2. **Threaded updates**: Parallel feed updates
3. **Adaptive quality**: Dynamic resolution based on performance
4. **Caching**: Intelligent frame caching for repeated content

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Feeds not updating
- **Solution**: Check that `update_feed()` is being called with valid pixmaps

**Issue**: Layout not changing
- **Solution**: Verify `feeds_changed` signal is connected and emitted

**Issue**: High latency
- **Solution**: Reduce frame rate or resolution, check system performance

**Issue**: Memory leaks
- **Solution**: Ensure feeds are properly removed, check pixmap cleanup

### Debug Information
Enable debug output by setting environment variable:
```bash
export JUGGLING_TRACKER_DEBUG=1
```
