## Simple Tracking Feature

The simple tracking feature provides a basic way to track the average position of close objects in the scene. This is useful for getting a general sense of where juggling balls are located before implementing more sophisticated individual ball tracking.

### Features:
- **Average Position Calculation**: Calculates the centroid of all objects considered "close" based on depth
- **Temporal Smoothing**: Averages positions across multiple frames for stability
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides reliability metrics for tracking results
- **Position Jump Detection**: Identifies and handles sudden position changes
- **Noise Reduction**: Morphological operations and Gaussian blur for cleaner masks
- **Preset Configurations**: Pre-configured settings for different environments (Indoor, Outdoor, Stable, Default)
- **Settings Persistence**: Save and load custom tracking configurations
- **Real-time Position Display**: Shows current tracking coordinates, confidence, and stability scores
- **Visual Overlay**: Shows average position with cyan cross and circle, individual objects with magenta dots
- **Real-time Statistics**: Displays object count and total area

### Simple Tracking Settings Window

The simple tracking controls are now located in a separate, dedicated settings window accessible via the "Simple Tracking Settings" button in the main window. This provides a clean, organized interface for fine-tuning the tracking system:

**Basic Controls:**
- **Proximity Threshold**: Distance threshold for object detection (0.05m - 0.50m)
- **Min/Max Object Size**: Size filtering to eliminate noise and irrelevant objects (10px - 10000px)

**Advanced Settings:**
- **Temporal Smoothing**: Number of frames to average for position stability (1-500 frames) - *Expanded range for long-term averaging*
- **Max Position Jump**: Maximum allowed position change between frames (10-1000px) - *Expanded range for varied tracking scenarios*
- **Confidence Threshold**: Minimum confidence required for valid tracking (0.0-1.0)
- **Noise Reduction**: Morphological operations kernel size (0-50px) - *Expanded range for heavy noise filtering*
- **Blur Radius**: Gaussian blur for mask preprocessing (0-25px) - *Expanded range for stronger smoothing*

**Presets:**
- **Indoor**: Optimized for controlled indoor lighting
- **Outdoor**: Adapted for variable outdoor conditions
- **Stable**: Maximum stability with heavy smoothing
- **Default**: Balanced settings for general use

**Settings Management:**
- **Save Settings**: Export current configuration to JSON file
- **Load Settings**: Import previously saved configurations

**Simple Tracking Mask View:**
- **Independent View**: Completely separate from the proximity mask view - can be shown alone or alongside other views
- **Show Simple Tracking Mask**: Toggle button to display a dedicated visualization of the simple tracking processing
- **Real-time Visualization**: Generates its own proximity mask with tracking overlays
- **Visual Elements**:
  - White areas: Objects detected within proximity threshold
  - Green contours: Valid objects (after size and perimeter filtering)
  - Magenta circles: Individual object centers with numbering
  - Cyan cross and circle: Current average position with coordinates
  - Orange circle: Smoothed/stable position (if different from average)
  - Parameter display: Shows current tracking settings and statistics
- **Live Parameter Feedback**: All slider changes are immediately reflected in the mask view
- **Flexible Display**: Can be shown without enabling the regular proximity mask view

**Position Display:**
The tracking position panel shows real-time data that extensions can access:
- Current position coordinates (same as `stable_position` in extension data)
- Confidence score (0.0-1.0)
- Stability score (0.0-1.0)

**Window Behavior:**
- The settings window can be opened and closed independently of the main window
- Settings remain active even when the window is closed
- All parameter changes take effect immediately
- The window is non-modal, allowing interaction with both windows simultaneously

### Controls:
- **Simple Tracking Settings Button**: Opens the dedicated settings window
- **Toggle Simple Tracking**: Use 'S' key or View menu to show/hide the overlay on main video
- **Toggle Simple Tracking Mask**: Use 'T' key or View â†’ "Toggle Simple Tracking Mask" menu to show/hide the dedicated tracking visualization
- **Simple Tracking Mask View**: Also available as toggle button in settings window
- **Video View Toggles**: Use 'C', 'D', 'M' keys to toggle color, depth, and mask views independently

### Usage:
1. Enable simple tracking from the View menu or press 'S'
2. Click "Simple Tracking Settings" to open the settings window
3. **Enable Simple Tracking Mask View**: Click "Show Simple Tracking Mask" for real-time visualization
4. Adjust the proximity threshold to focus on objects at the right distance
5. Set min/max object sizes to filter out noise and background objects
6. Fine-tune advanced parameters:
   - **Temporal smoothing**: Use up to 500 frames for very stable long-term averaging
   - **Position jump detection**: Set higher thresholds for fast-moving objects
   - **Noise reduction**: Use larger kernel sizes for noisy environments
7. **Real-time feedback**: Watch the tracking mask view update as you adjust sliders
8. **For focused analysis**: Use the dedicated tracking mask view alongside or instead of the main video feeds
9. The cyan cross shows the average position with coordinates displayed
10. Individual objects are marked with numbered magenta circles
11. Orange markers show smoothed positions when different from raw average

This feature is designed as a stepping stone toward more advanced individual ball tracking and can be used by extensions for basic position data. The ability to view only the proximity mask is particularly useful for fine-tuning the tracking parameters.

## Fallback Modes

The application supports three modes of operation:

1. **RealSense Mode** (default): Uses the Intel RealSense depth camera for tracking. This provides the best results with accurate depth information.

2. **Webcam Mode**: Uses a standard webcam for tracking. This mode doesn't have real depth information, so tracking may be less accurate.

3. **Simulation Mode**: Generates simulated balls and hands for testing. This mode doesn't require any camera.

If the RealSense camera is not available, the application will automatically try to fall back to webcam mode, and if that fails, to simulation mode.

You can explicitly select a mode using the command-line options:
```
python run_juggling_tracker.py --webcam
python run_juggling_tracker.py --simulation
```

## Architecture

The system is built with a modular architecture that separates concerns and allows for easy extension and modification.

### Core Components

1. **Frame Acquisition Module**: Handles the camera setup and frame capture
2. **Depth Processing Module**: Processes depth data to identify potential ball candidates
3. **Skeleton Detection Module**: Detects the juggler's skeleton and extracts hand positions
4. **Blob Detection Module**: Detects potential ball candidates in the filtered depth mask
5. **Simple Tracker Module**: Provides basic tracking of average object positions
6. **Color Calibration Module**: Handles the calibration of ball colors
7. **Ball Identification Module**: Identifies which blob corresponds to which ball
8. **Multi-Ball Tracking Module**: Tracks multiple balls in 3D space
9. **Visualization Module**: Displays the tracking results and UI elements
10. **UI Manager**: Handles the user interface for the application
11. **Extension Manager**: Manages the registration and execution of extensions

## Extending the System

The system is designed to be extensible, with clear entry points for adding new functionality.

### Creating a New Extension

1. Create a new Python file in the `juggling_tracker/extensions` directory
2. Define a class that inherits from `Extension`
3. Implement the required methods:
   - `initialize()`: Initialize the extension
   - `process_frame(frame_data)`: Process a frame of data
   - `get_results()`: Get the results of the extension
   - `get_name()`: Get the name of the extension
4. The extension will be automatically discovered and can be enabled/disabled from the UI

Example:

```python
from juggling_tracker.extensions.extension_manager import Extension

class MyExtension(Extension):
    def __init__(self):
        self.count = 0
    
    def initialize(self):
        return True
    
    def process_frame(self, frame_data):
        # Process the frame data
        self.count += 1
        return {'count': self.count}
    
    def get_results(self):
        return {'count': self.count}
    
    def get_name(self):
        return "MyExtension"
```

## Included Extensions

The system comes with two example extensions:

1. **Catch Counter**: Counts the number of catches and drops in a juggling pattern
2. **Siteswap Detector**: Analyzes ball trajectories to determine the siteswap pattern

## Future Extensions

The system is designed to be extended with new functionality, such as:

1. **Improved Siteswap Detection**: More accurate pattern recognition with validation
2. **Training Mode**: Guide users through juggling exercises
3. **Pattern Consistency Rating**: Analyze the consistency of juggling patterns
4. **Trick Recognition**: Identify common juggling tricks
5. **Multi-Person Tracking**: Track multiple jugglers simultaneously

## Troubleshooting

### RealSense Camera Issues

If you encounter issues with the RealSense camera, try the following:

1. Make sure the RealSense SDK is installed correctly
2. Try running the application with the `--webcam` or `--simulation` option to use a fallback mode
3. If you have a custom build of librealsense, the application will automatically try to find it in `~/Projects/librealsense/build/Release`

### Webcam Issues

If you encounter issues with the webcam, try the following:

1. Make sure your webcam is connected and working
2. Try a different webcam index with the `--camera-index` option
